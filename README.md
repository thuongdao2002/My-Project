# Telco-Customer Retiontion 
Data Analysis Project - using Excel, Power BI
Project objective: Analyze what factors affect customer churn at Telco Telecommunications Company. From there, offer solutions to help retain customers. 
I clean the data and write DAX statements to calculate the necessary measures and visualize them on Power BI. After analyzing, I found the top 6 factors affecting customer abandonment, which are:
1. Month-to-month contracts
2. Online Security
3. Tech Support
4. Fiber optic as internet service
5. Payment method: electronic check
6. Tenure

Based on these factors, I give suitable key performance factors
